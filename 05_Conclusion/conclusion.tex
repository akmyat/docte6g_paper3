\section{Conclusion}

This study successfully bridges a significant gap in network simulation tools by introducing a native, open-source MQTT v3.1.1 module for ns-3, enabling rigorous validation of Industrial IoT environments which can be found in \url{https://gitlab.com/simulations9070736/mqtt.git}.
Through the implementation of a comprehensive Smart Warehouse Digital Twin scenario, we demonstrated that while MQTT is inherently lightweight, its reliability for mission-critical control is heavily dependent on the underlying network infrastructure.
Our comparative analysis reveals that 5G New Radio (NR) provides the deterministic latency required for robot synchronization, effectively mitigating the protocol overhead observed in higher Quality of Service (QoS) levels, whereas Wi-Fi 6 remains a viable, cost-efficient option for high-bandwidth telemetry where jitter is less critical.
