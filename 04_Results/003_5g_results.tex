\subsubsection{Deployment over 5G NR Connectivity}

Figure \ref{fig:5g_telemetry_results} reports telemetry results over a standalone 5G NR deployment at 3.5 GHz. Latencies remain nearly constant across all QoS levels at $\approx$ 23.5 ms, an effect not observed in Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Here, MQTT overhead becomes negligible relative to 5G’s intrinsic radio scheduling, frame timing (TTI granularity), and core-network processing delays. Telemetry performance is thus dominated by RAN behavior, not protocol semantics.

Operational message results (Fig.  \ref{fig:5g_operations_results}) show that package detection maintains the highest latency ( $\approx$ 55–59 ms), while other operations remain between 22–34 ms. Interestingly, QoS 2 sometimes yields lower latency than QoS 0, likely due to reduced RLC/MAC retransmission events when MQTT ensures reliability at the application layer. This reinforces that under 5G NR, radio-layer effects outweigh QoS-driven overhead.

Control message latency (Fig. \ref{fig:5g_control_results}) ranges from 31–39 ms for assignment and 25–26 ms for completion across QoS levels. The small differences between QoS 0, 1, and 2 confirm that MQTT handshake overhead is almost entirely masked by 5G’s air-interface latency. These results indicate that 5G NR supports reliable robot control under QoS 1/2 without the latency penalties seen in Ethernet, albeit at higher absolute latency than Wi-Fi.
