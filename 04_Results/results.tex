\section{Results}
In this section, we present the results obtained from our experiments.
First, we verify that our implementaiton working as expected by comparing QoS metrics across different Ethernet speeds and payload sizes.
Then, we analyze the performance of our proposed architecture in the context of a Smart Warehouse Digital Twin application.
