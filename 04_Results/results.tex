\section{Results and Analysis}
This section presents the evaluation of the proposed MQTT ns-3 module and its behavior across heterogeneous networks within the Smart Warehouse Digital Twin scenario. We first validate correctness by comparing QoS behavior under controlled Ethernet conditions, followed by a detailed analysis of telemetry, operational, and control traffic over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and 5G NR.
