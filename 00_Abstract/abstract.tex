Industry 4.0 has driven the evolution of logistics into Smart Warehouses, which rely on Digital Twins (DT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to manage complex operations with minimal human intervention.
The effectiveness of these systems depends on the "communication thread" between virtual models and physical assets, where the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol serves as the standard for data synchronization.
However, the widely respected ns-3 network simulator currently lacks a native, open-source model for MQTT, limiting the ability to validate these protocols over modern wireless networks prior to deployment.
This paper addresses this gap by developing a comprehensive, open-source MQTT v3.1.1 module for ns-3 that supports all Quality of Service (QoS) levels (0, 1, and 2).
Using this module, a realistic Smart Warehouse scenario was designed to simulate heterogeneous traffic types, including robot control commands and sensor telemetry.
The study provides a comparative analysis of MQTT performance over wired Ethernet, Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), and 5G New Radio (NR).
Simulation results indicate that while Wi-Fi 6 offers bandwidth efficiency, 5G NR provides superior stability for mission-critical control traffic, with latency dominated by radio scheduling rather than MQTT protocol overhead.
These findings offer a validated framework for optimizing communication infrastructures in industrial DT applications.
