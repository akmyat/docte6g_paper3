Digital Twins (DTs) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasingly central to Smart Warehouse automation, where reliable and timely synchronization between physical assets and their virtual models is fundamental. MQTT has become the dominant application-layer protocol enabling this “communication thread,” yet no open-source or modifiable implementation exists for the ns-3 network simulator, limiting the ability to evaluate MQTT deployments across heterogeneous wireless infrastructures. This work fills this gap by developing a complete MQTT v3.1.1 module for ns-3 with full QoS 0/1/2 support, including client–broker state management, session persistence, and reliability handshakes. Using the module, we construct a detailed Smart Warehouse DT scenario comprising robot-control traffic, sensor telemetry, and surveillance streams, and evaluate its performance over Ethernet, Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), and 5G NR. Results show that while higher MQTT QoS levels introduce additional protocol overhead, their impact is overshadowed in 5G NR by radio-level scheduling delays, enabling reliable control signalling without substantial latency penalties. Wi-Fi 6 provides competitive performance for telemetry and non-critical workloads but suffers jitter in dense settings. The developed MQTT module and the presented comparative analysis form a validated foundation for designing communication-efficient DT architectures in Industry 4.0 environments.
