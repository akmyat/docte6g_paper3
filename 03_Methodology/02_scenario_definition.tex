\subsection{Smart Warehouse Digital Twin Scenario Description}

In the smart warehouse scenario illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:smart_warehouse_scenario} depicts a cyber-physical system where various interconnected components work together to manage warehouse operations efficiently.
The \textit{controller} serves as the central hub for coordinating activities, sending commands, storing data, and maintaining overall situational awareness.
\textit{Package sensors} are placed at the conveyor belts that receive incoming packages, detecting their arrival. These sensors then send notifications to the controller whenever a new package arrives.
When a new package arrives, the controller checks if there exists any available storage space in the \text{racks} by sending requests and receiving the status update.
It also verifies that the \textit{mobile robots} are available to pickup and transport the packages to the designated storage locations.
Once the controller confirms the availability of both storage space and mobile robots, it dispatches commands to the mobile robots to pick up the packages from the conveyor belt and deliver them to the assigned racks.
Whenever the controller receives a request to retrieve a package, it checks for the availability of mobile robots and sends commands to the robot to fetch the package from the specified rack. Then the package is delivered to the \textit{drop zone} and the status of the racks are updated accordingly.
The environmental sensors such as temperature and humidity sensors continuously monitor the warehouse conditions and send periodic updates to the controller to ensure optimal storage environment.
The video cameras positioned throughout the warehouse stream real-time footage to the controller for safety monitoring and surveillance.

These components generate diverse traffic types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Robot control commands (e.g. destination update, pick and place instructions), which require ultra-low latency ($<10$--$20$~ms) and high reliability, as they influence mechanical actuations and safety.
    \item Status updates from environmental sensors, package sensors, and rack availability sensors, which produce periodic traffic with moderate latency requirements ($<100$--$200$~ms).
    \item Video streams from fixed cameras, which generate high-bandwidth data flow with tighter jitter constraints ($<150$--$300$~ms) to support real-time monitoring.
\end{itemize}
Together, these heterogeneous traffic profiles reflect realistic operational conditions in a smart warehouse DT system.
