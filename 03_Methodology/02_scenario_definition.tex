\subsection{Smart Warehouse Digital Twin Scenario Definition}

The smart warehouse scenario \ref{fig:smart_warehouse_scenario} consists of interconnected cyber-physcial components that collaboratively store, retrieve, transport, monitor, and manage inventory within a warehouse environment. 
The environment includes \textbf{mobile robots} responsible for picking, placing and transporting pakcages across the warehouse, \textbf{racks} equipped with storage availability sensors, \textbf{package sensors} that detect package arrival, \textbf{environmental sensors}: to monitor ambient temperature and humidity, and \textbf{video cameras} for safety monitoring.
A centralized \textbf{controller} orchestrates the operations by assigning tasks, dispatching commands while maintaining global situational awareness.

These components generate diverse traffic types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Robot control commands (e.g. destination update, pick and place instructions), which require ultra-low latency (<10-20ms) and high relaiblity, as they influence mechanical actuatio and safety.
    \item Status updates from environmental sensors, package sensors, and rack availability sensors, which produce periodic traffic with moderate latency requirements (<100-200ms).
    \item Video streams from fixed cameras, which generate high-bandwidth data flow with tighter jitter constraints to support real-time monitoring.
\end{itemize}
Together, these heterogeneous traffic profiles reflect realistic operational conditions in a smart warehouse DT system.

The component in the smart warehouse DT system and their interactions are illustrated in the class diagram in Figure \ref{fig:class_diagram_smart_warehouse_scenario}.
